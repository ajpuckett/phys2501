Originally introduced by Max Planck to resolve an apparent conflict between
electromagnetism and statistical mechanics, Planck's constant now occupies
a central position (together with the speed of light) as one of the two
universal constants governing the behavior of all physical systems.  When
electrons undergo transitions between different energy states in a solid
they sometimes release energy in the form of a quantum of light called a
photon.  Planck's constant relates the frequency of a photon to its energy.
In this experiment, students measure the energy of an electronic transition
in terms of the voltage that is required to produce it.  By comparing that
electrical potential with the frequency of the light emitted in the
transition, the value of Planck's constant is extracted.
