Fourier's theorem states that it is possible to express an arbitrary
periodic function as a superposition of sine waves which have the same
period as the original function.  Fourier analysis is the task of finding the
amplitude and phase of a particular sine waves that is hidden inside a
periodic function.  It is a powerful technique used by physicists and
engineers to discover a weak periodic signal that might be buried under
large amounts of electronic noise.  Ham radio, GPS receivers, and cell phones
all use variations on this principle.  In this experiment, students practice
analyzing the frequency components of a variety of simple periodic functions,
and compare their results with the measurements using a function generator
and an oscilloscope.
