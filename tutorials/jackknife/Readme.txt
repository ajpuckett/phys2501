This tutorial applies the lesson presented in class on fitting experimental
data to a model formula that depends on unknown parameters in a non-linear
fashion. The particular model studied in the tutorial is the one-dimensional
function which describes the equilibrium shape of a freely hanging chain in a
uniform gravitational field. Students are asked to find the best values for
the three unknown model parameters by minimizing the &chi;<sup>2</sup>
statistic using the Solver tool in Microsoft Excel, and to estimate the
errors on these best-fit parameters using the &quot;jackknife&quot; procedure.
