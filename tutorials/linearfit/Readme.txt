This tutorial applies the lesson presented in class on fitting experimental
data to a model formula that depends on unknown parameters in a linear
fashion.  Students are presented with two independent data sets A and B,
each of which consists of a sequence of measurements {<i>x<sub>i</sub>,
y<sub>i</sub>, &sigma;<sub>i</sub></i>}.  Values of the slope and y-intercept
parameters that minimize the &chi;<sup>2</sub> parameter for each data set
must be obtained, together with their errors.  Students must then compute the
intersection point of the two best-fit lines, and determine the experimental
errors on the coordinates of the intersection by propagating the errors on
the individual best-fit slopes and y-intercepts into the result.
