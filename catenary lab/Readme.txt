The equilibrium shape of a uniform and perfectly flexible string that hangs
freely from two fixed points is called a "catenary".  Galileo Galilei
speculated that the shape corresponded to a parabola.  Somewhat later,
Isaac Newton proved that in the limit of a uniform gravitational field the
ideal shape correspondes to a hyperbolic cosine.  This experiment tests
these two hypotheses to determine if either one, or both, or neither is
correct.
