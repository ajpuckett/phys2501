This experiment employs a pendulum that is designed to swing from either end
to measure the local value of the gravitational acceleration g.  By adjusting
the position of a movable mass attached to the pendulum, the experimenter
seeks to equalize the oscillation periods of the pendulum when hanging from
either end.  When the periods are equal, the local value of g emerges as
a simple function of the measured period and the distance between the two
pivot points.
