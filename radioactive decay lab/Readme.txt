Radioactive nuclei obey the well-known exponential decay law, according to
which the number of unstable nuclei <i>N</i> remaining in a sample is
described by a straight line with a negative slope on a plot of the log(N)
versus time.  The absolute value of the slope of this line is known as the
&quot;lifetime&quot; of the unstable nucleus.  However, it only describes the
average lifetime of the nucleus; actual nuclei of this type can live much
shorter or much longer lifetimes.  According to quantum mechanics, these
individual decay events are fundamentally random, and are described by random
statistics of independent events.  This experiment measures the decay rate of
a sample of uranium.  Observations are compared with the predictions of the
statistical model.
