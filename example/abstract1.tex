\begin{abstract}
New measurements are presented 
of the inclusive forward-backward $t\overline{t}$ production asymmetry, $A_{FB}$,
and its dependence on several properties of the $t\overline{t}$ system.
The measurements are performed with the full Tevatron data set recorded with
the CDF II detector during $p\overline{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 1.96$~TeV,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.4~fb$^{-1}$.
The asymmetry is measured using the rapidity difference $\Delta y = y_t - y_{\overline{t}}$.
Parton-level results are derived, yielding an inclusive asymmetry of
 $0.164\pm 0.047$ (stat + syst).
The results establish an approximately linear dependence of $A_{FB}$ on the top-quark pair
mass $M_{t\overline{t}}$ and the rapidity difference $|\Delta y|$ at detector and
parton levels. Assuming the standard model, the probabilities to observe
the measured values or larger for the detector-level dependencies
are $7.4\times 10^{-3}$ and $2.2\times 10^{-3}$
for $M_{t\overline{t}}$ and $|\Delta y|$, respectively.
Lastly, we study the dependence of the asymmetry on the transverse momentum
of the $t\overline{t}$ system at the detector level. These results are
consistent with previous lower-precision measurements and provide additional
quantification of the functional dependencies of the asymmetry.

%% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the

%% The ruledtabular enviroment adds doubled rules to table and sets a

%% Use the table* environment to get a full-width table in two-column
