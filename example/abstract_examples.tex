The proton is the primary building block of the visible Universe, but many of its properties-such as its charge radius and its anomalous magnetic moment-are not well understood. The root-mean-square charge radius, r$_p$, has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r$_p$ (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED). The accuracy of r$_p$ as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r$_p$ is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz. On the basis of present calculations of fine and hyperfine splittings and QED terms, we find r$_p$ = 0.84184(67) fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value of 0.8768(69) fm. Our result implies that either the Rydberg constant has to be shifted by −110 kHz/c (4.9 standard deviations), or the calculations of the QED effects in atomic hydrogen or muonic hydrogen atoms are insufficient.

We report the first measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry A$_{PV}$ in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from $^{208}$Pb. A$_{PV}$ is sensitive to the radius of the neutron distribution (R$_n$). The result A$_{PV} = 0.656 \pm 0.060$ (stat) $\pm 0.014 $(syst) ppm corresponds to a difference between the radii of the neutron and proton distributions $R_n - R_p = 0.33 +0.16 -0.18$ fm and provides the first electroweak observation of the neutron skin which is expected in a heavy, neutron-rich nucleus.

Among the most fundamental observables of nucleon structure, electromagnetic form factors are a crucial benchmark for modern calculations describing the strong interaction dynamics of the nucleon's quark constituents; indeed, recent proton data have attracted intense theoretical interest. In this Letter, we report new measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factor ratio using the recoil polarization method, at momentum transfers Q$^2$=5.2, 6.7, and 8.5  GeV$^2$. By extending the range of Q$^2$ for which $G_E^p$ is accurately determined by more than 50\%, these measurements will provide significant constraints on models of nucleon structure in the nonperturbative regime.
