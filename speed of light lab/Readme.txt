The speed of light in vacuum is one of the best known quantities in all of
physics.  In fact, measurements of the speed of light became so precise in
the mid-twentieth century that the uncertainty in the definition of the meter
itself became the largest contribution to its error.  As a result, it was
decided that the length of the meter should no longer be the standard, but
instead be defined in terms of a fixed speed of light.  Even though the speed
of light is fixed by definition today, it is still valid to measure it using
laboratory standards for the meter and the second.  In this experiment, 
students measure the speed of light in air using Fizeau's rotating mirror
method, and compare it with the established value in m/s.
