The simple harmonic oscillator is special because it supports just one
frequency of oscillation, no matter what initial conditions are used.
Real-world objects, on the other hand, typically have many different ways (or
"modes") in which they may oscillate or vibrate, and support many different
frequencies. One of the most beautiful results in all of mechanics is the way
that complicated oscillators with multiple oscillation frequencies can be
decomposed into a set of independent harmonic oscillators, each of which
has just one frequency and behaves like a simple harmonic oscillator
independent of all of the others. In this experiment, students explore how
connecting two similar pendulums with a spring creates such a multi-mode
oscillator, and how its motion is decomposed into two separate modes, each
with its own unique frequency and characteristic type of motion.
