In its simplest form, a harmonic oscillator is modelled as a system subject
to just one force, the restoring force that pulls the system back toward the
equilibrium position.  Real-world oscillators, however, have additional forces
that act on them and modify their behavior from the simple ideal case.  One
of these additional forces is called "drag", which dissipates energy from the
system and causes the oscillation to slow down (or "damp out") over time.  To
keep the oscillations from damping out to zero, one often finds that there is
another force (the "driving" force) acting on the system, which provides an
external source of energy and keeps the oscillations from damping to zero.
Such a system has two frequencies present, the frequency of the driving force
and the natural frequency of the damped oscillator itself.  This experiment
explores the behavior of a damped oscillator, and allows students to introduce
and control driving forces of various kinds.  The response of the system is
compared to the predictions of a simple Newtonian model for the damped 
driven oscillator.
